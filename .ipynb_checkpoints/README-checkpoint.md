## Background

For this homework assignment, I created a Jupyter notebook that analyzes the rental housing market of San Francisco

### Files

The Instructions folder contains all the files for this assignment. In the folder you'll find an Images folder and the Starter Code folder provided to us. In the Starter Code folder you'll find the San Francisco Housing jupyter notebook completed per the Instructions.

##### Plots

First, I created a bar chart of the housing units per year.

Second, I created a line plot showing the sales price per square foot and gross rent by year.

Third, I created the same line plot showing the sales price per square foot and gross rent by year but grouped by neighborhoods.

Last, I created an Interactive Neighborhood Map of all the housing rental properties.
